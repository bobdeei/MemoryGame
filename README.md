    Bug: Self-matching if clicked twice on the same card.

May 20th 2018

    The self-matching bug is just fixed. Clicking the same card twice now won't increment the move counter as well as cause self-matching behavior.

    One fun thing I just add is the sound effect for fliped, matched, or unmatched cards. There is a congratulation sound if all cards are successfully matched. This is interesting beacuse the sound tend to go with the matched animation. You'll see this if you win the game. I'll try to better sync the animation and the sound effect so they look like they go together.

    The next issue to solve would be responsiveness.

If you find any further issue, please do whatever you can to let me know. I'm new to programming and still getting used to with Git and Github.

Thank you!
