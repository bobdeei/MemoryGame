# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

I have added a shortcut to restart the game. You can simply press 'R' to restart the game.

## Note

One significant bug right now is if a card is sequentially clicked twice, it will become a match with itself. It is a logical bug due to my first approach and attempt on this project. However, I have not fixed it earlier in the process. The project is not big that it bothers me to think about this.

If you have any idea on this. Please give me some suggestion.

Otherwise, all basic functionalities of the game work well.

If you find any issue, please do whatever you can to let me know. I'm new and still getting used to with Git and Github.

Thank you!
